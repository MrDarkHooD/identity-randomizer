# identity-randomizer
Small script to randomize your identity in irc

This script is still unfinished. It worked on my webserver when it was uploaded here.

It prints first random first name from file names.txt and if last letter is s it adds in end "'". If last letter is not s, it prints "'s".
Example:
Larry's
James'

Then it randomizes machine. Example: Larry's MacBook Pro

After that it prints random nickname.
Rules for nickname:
1. First letter is uppercase
2. If first letter is consonant, second letter must be vocal.
3. If third letter is consonant, forth letter must be vocal.
4. Nickname contains 5 letters

I am gonna translate this to python and add script to edit irc information on launch.
